# Shell aliases for PACK_NAME pack
#
# This file is sourced into your shell during 'dodot deploy PACK_NAME'
# Changes take effect immediately in new shells or after re-deployment.
# 
# Works with bash, zsh, fish (via bass), and other POSIX shells.
# For shell-specific syntax, check $SHELL or $0
#
# Safe to keep empty or remove. By keeping it, you can add
# aliases later that become live without redeploying the pack.

# Add your aliases below
# Examples:
# alias ll='ls -la'
# alias g='git'
# alias dc='docker-compose'
