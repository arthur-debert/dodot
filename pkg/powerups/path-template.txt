# PATH modifications for PACK_NAME pack
#
# This file is sourced to add directories to your PATH
# during 'dodot deploy PACK_NAME'
# 
# Use absolute paths or paths relative to $HOME
# dodot handles deduplication automatically
#
# Safe to keep empty or remove. By keeping it, you can add
# PATH entries later without redeploying the pack.

# Add PATH exports below
# Examples:
# export PATH="$HOME/.PACK_NAME/bin:$PATH"
# export PATH="/usr/local/PACK_NAME/bin:$PATH"
