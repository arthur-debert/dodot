# dodot install script for PACK_NAME pack
# 
# This script runs ONCE during 'dodot install PACK_NAME'
# Use it for one-time setup tasks like:
# - Installing dependencies not available via Homebrew
# - Creating directories
# - Downloading external resources
# - Setting up initial configurations
#
# The script is idempotent - dodot tracks execution via checksums
# and won't run it again unless the file contents change.
#
# Safe to keep empty or remove. By keeping it, you can add
# installation steps later without redeploying the pack.
