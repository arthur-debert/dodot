                   Help Topics System
                   ==================

dodot includes a custom help topics system that extends Cobra's built-in help
to provide rich, file-based documentation accessible from the CLI.

Overview
--------

The help topics system allows users to get detailed help on concepts, flags,
and features directly from the command line:

$ dodot help dry-run
$ dodot help architecture
$ dodot help packs

Implementation
--------------

The system is implemented in pkg/cobrax/topics and provides:

1. Topic Discovery
   - Scans docs/help/ directory for topic files
   - Supports .txt, .txxt, and .md files
   - Topic name = filename without extension

2. Help Command Override
   - Custom help command checks for topics first
   - Falls back to Cobra's help for commands
   - Handles flag-style topics (--dry-run → dry-run)

3. Integration Points
   - Initialized in internal/cli/commands.go
   - Searches multiple paths for flexibility
   - Logs initialization for debugging

Adding New Topics
-----------------

1. Create a file in docs/help/
2. Name it after the topic (e.g., workflows.txxt)
3. Write clear, structured documentation
4. Test with: dodot help workflows

Topic Guidelines
----------------

• Start with a title and separator
• Include practical examples
• Keep sections short and scannable
• Use bullet points for lists
• End with use cases or tips
