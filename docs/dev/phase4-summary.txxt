PHASE 4 HANDLER REFACTORING SUMMARY


    1. Overview

        This document summarizes the Phase 4 implementation of the action
        refactor project (#604). Phase 4 focused on incrementally refactoring
        all existing handlers to use the new ActionV2 and Handler interfaces.


    2. Handlers Refactored

        2.1 Linking Handlers

            The following handlers implement LinkingHandlerV2:

            - *SymlinkHandlerV2*: Creates symbolic links from matched files to
              target locations. Returns LinkAction instances.

            - *PathHandlerV2*: Adds directories to PATH. Returns
              AddToPathAction instances.

            - *ShellProfileHandlerV2*: Manages shell profile modifications by
              sourcing scripts. Returns AddToShellProfileAction instances.


        2.2 Provisioning Handlers

            The following handlers implement ProvisioningHandlerV2:

            - *ProvisionScriptHandlerV2*: Runs install.sh scripts for initial
              setup. Returns RunScriptAction instances with calculated
              checksums.

            - *HomebrewHandlerV2*: Processes Brewfiles to install Homebrew
              packages. Returns RunScriptAction instances with a special
              sentinel naming pattern for identification.


    3. Key Design Decisions

        - All handlers maintain their original functionality while adapting to
          the new interfaces

        - Each handler now returns specific action types instead of the generic
          Action struct

        - Checksums are calculated for provisioning scripts to enable
          idempotent execution

        - The V2 suffix is used to maintain compatibility during the transition
          period

        - Comprehensive unit tests were added for each handler


    4. Special Considerations

        - The HomebrewHandler returns RunScriptAction but requires special
          handling in the executor to run "brew bundle --file=<path>" instead
          of executing the Brewfile directly

        - All handlers implement both the base Handler interface and their
          specific LinkingHandlerV2 or ProvisioningHandlerV2 interface


    5. Next Steps

        Phase 5 will involve:
        - Updating the core pipeline to use the new handlers
        - Removing the old handler implementations
        - Updating the executor to handle Homebrew actions specially
        - Full system integration testing
