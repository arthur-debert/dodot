                   Live System Integration Tests

Because dodot manages users' files in their home directories, we need maximum
confidence in correct, predictable behavior. While unit tests and Go integration
tests are fundamental, having a safe sandbox that replicates a full working
machine with home directories and applications provides opportunities for both
manual validation and automated tests.

Using a Docker container sandbox allows us to test without risking data loss
and easily test combinations of user homes, dotfiles collections, and dodot's
previous data states.

Objective
---------

The goal is a one-line command that will:

• Run the test environment container
• Set up dodot (build from source, set variables, install shell profile init)
• Iterate through various scenarios
  - Each scenario combines: user home-dir, dotfiles, and specific tests
  - For each test:
    • Setup: Delete affected dirs (home, dotfiles root, dodot state/data)
    • Setup: Copy fresh dirs from the scenario templates
    • Setup: Set environment variables ($HOME, $DOTFILES_ROOT, etc.)
    • Run the test
    • Teardown: Delete test dirs
    • Teardown: Unset environment variables

This allows us to create scenarios with actual files that are easy to reason
about, shell into, and experiment with.

Tools and Guidelines
--------------------

Environment:
• Ubuntu container (fixed OS target for consistent dependencies)
• Docker container with full repo mounted
• Includes working Homebrew installation (key power-up)
• Zsh shell (what most users run)
• Not container-specific - could run outside container if needed

Test Framework:
• Bats (Bash Automated Testing System)
  - Mature and widely adopted
  - Better debugging support than alternatives
  - Clean assertion syntax
  - Excellent TAP/JUnit output
  - Works with zsh

Test Code Structure:
• Bulk of test logic in standalone shell scripts
• Less framework lock-in
• Automated setup/teardown guarantees clean slate
• Most tests will be simple:
  ```
  dodot deploy
  assert that /file got deployed by power-up x
  ```
• Library of assertions for each power-up type
• Helper commands for debugging (file tree display, logs)
• Test failures show file trees + application logs

Scope and Simplicity
--------------------

This is a deliberately small, targeted suite. Shell testing in containers can
be cumbersome, so we optimize for clarity and debuggability.

Target scope:
• 2-3 tests per power-up (happy path + edge case)
• 10-15 combination scenarios (deploy only, install only, mixed)
• 10-15 environment edge cases (env vars, git repo discovery)
• Total: 60-80 tests maximum

Most tests will have zero actual shell code, using common assertions instead.
Total codebase target: ~1000 lines including all support code.

Test Categories
---------------

Power-up Tests:
• Symlink deployment
• Shell profile sourcing
• PATH additions
• Install script execution
• Brewfile processing
• Template processing

Environment Tests:
• DOTFILES_ROOT discovery (env var, git root, pwd fallback)
• Missing directories
• Permission errors (read-only dirs)
• State corruption (corrupted deployment-metadata)

Combination Tests:
• Multiple power-ups in one pack
• Multiple packs
• Deploy after install
• Repeated deployments

Test Plan Implementation
------------------------

The detailed test plan with specific test cases organized in 5 progressive suites
is maintained in: `containers/dev/test-plan.txt`

This includes:
• Suite 1: Single power-ups (foundation)
• Suite 2: Multiple power-ups, single packs
• Suite 3: Multiple power-ups, multiple packs
• Suite 4: Single power-up edge cases
• Suite 5: Complex multi-pack edge cases

On How Power-Ups Work
---------------------

The range of tests and assertions we do here will actually cross work done by
the matcher, the trigger,power-ups, actions and the execution engine..

Since piercing this information together is laborious, we have a detail
documentation for each power-up that has the full cycle information and is
indispensable for this work. See: 

pkg/powerups/homebrew/doc.go
pkg/powerups/install/doc.go
pkg/powerups/path/doc.go
pkg/powerups/shell_add_path/doc.go
pkg/powerups/shell_profile/doc.go
pkg/powerups/symlink/doc.go
pkg/powerups/template/doc.go

Assertion Library Design
------------------------

Each power-up gets specific assertions:

assertions/symlink.sh:
• assert_symlink_deployed() - verify both intermediate and target links - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions.sh)
• assert_symlink_not_deployed() - verify clean removal - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions.sh)

assertions/shell_profile.sh:
• assert_shell_profile_sourced() - check DODOT_SHELL_SOURCE_FLAG - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions_shell.sh)
• assert_profile_in_init() - verify entry in init.sh - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions_shell.sh)

assertions/path.sh:
• assert_path_deployed() - verify bin directory deployment - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions_path.sh)
• assert_path_added() - verify PATH environment variable - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions_path.sh)
• assert_path_in_shell_init() - verify PATH in init.sh - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions_path.sh)

assertions/install_script.sh:
• assert_install_script_executed() - verify script ran - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions_install.sh)
• assert_install_script_not_executed() - verify script didn't run - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions_install.sh)
• assert_install_artifact_exists() - verify artifacts created - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions_install.sh)

assertions/homebrew.sh:
• assert_brewfile_processed() - verify Brewfile execution - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions_homebrew.sh)
• assert_brewfile_not_processed() - verify Brewfile skipped - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions_homebrew.sh)

• assert_dir_exists() - directory checks - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions.sh)
• assert_env_set() - environment validation - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions.sh)
• assert_executable_available() - verify executable in PATH - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions_path.sh)

Debug Tooling
-------------

Built-in debug helpers from day one:

debug_state() - dumps complete system state: - DONE (test-data/lib/debug.sh)
• Tree view of DOTFILES_ROOT
• Tree view of HOME (depth limited)
• Tree view of DODOT_DATA_DIR
• All relevant environment variables
• Recent dodot log entries

debug_on_fail() - automatically called on test failures - DONE (test-data/lib/debug.sh)

Additional debug helpers implemented:
• debug_symlinks() - shows all symlinks in HOME - DONE (test-data/lib/debug.sh)
• debug_shell_integration() - shows shell profile state - DONE (test-data/lib/assertions_shell.sh)

Test Runner Implementation
--------------------------

The test system uses Bats native capabilities for maximum compatibility:

• runner-native.sh - Simplified runner leveraging Bats formatters
• junit-summary.py - Python formatter for human-readable suite summaries
• Native support for JUnit, TAP, and pretty output formats

Running tests:
```
# All tests with summary
./containers/dev/run-tests-native.sh

# Specific suite or file
./containers/dev/run-tests-native.sh test-data/scenarios/suite-1/**/*.bats

# With JUnit output
./containers/dev/run-tests-native.sh --formatter junit
```

• Real files in real directories (no programmatic generation) ✓ DONE
• Debug tools available from the start ✓ DONE
• Small incremental steps with verification ✓ DONE
• Focus on high-value tests that catch real bugs ✓ DONE
• Optimize for maintainability over execution speed ✓ DONE

Current Status
--------------

Infrastructure: ✓ DONE
• Docker container with all dependencies

Open Issues
-----------

1. Test runner exit behavior with set -e
   - Fixed: Runner now handles bats non-zero exit codes properly
   - All test suites now run even if earlier ones fail

2. Test output truncation in some environments
   - Not a blocking issue - can run tests individually for debugging
   - Workaround: Use run-tests-summary.sh for concise output
