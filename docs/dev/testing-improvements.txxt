# Testing Improvements for dodot Commands

This document summarizes the testing improvements made to ensure commands actually work as expected.

## What We Fixed

### 1. genconfig Command Tests
- **Issue**: Test file was marked as "toremove" and not running
- **Fix**: Activated and updated tests to use proper test environment
- **Coverage**: Now tests all functionality including:
  - Output to stdout
  - Writing to single/multiple packs
  - Skipping existing files
  - Creating missing directories
  - Filesystem injection support

### 2. fill Command Tests  
- **Issue**: Command was broken (TODO: Re-implement) but tests passed
- **Fix**: Fixed command implementation and added comprehensive tests
- **Coverage**: Tests verify:
  - Template creation for missing handlers
  - Skipping handlers with existing files
  - Proper file permissions
  - Integration with rules system

### 3. init Command Tests
- **Issue**: Command used hardcoded templates instead of rules system
- **Fix**: Reimplemented to use fill command and added integration tests
- **Coverage**: Tests verify:
  - Pack creation with all expected files
  - Integration with fill command
  - Config file generation
  - Error handling

## Testing Best Practices Applied

### 1. Use TestEnvironment
All tests now use the proper test environment:
```go
env := testutil.NewTestEnvironment(t, testutil.EnvMemoryOnly)
defer env.Cleanup()
```

### 2. Filesystem Injection
Commands support filesystem injection for testing:
```go
type Options struct {
    FileSystem types.FS // Optional for testing
}
```

### 3. Verify Actual Functionality
Tests don't just check if files exist, they verify:
- File contents are correct
- Permissions are set properly
- Integration with other commands works
- Generated files work with handlers

### 4. Test Error Cases
Each command has tests for:
- Invalid inputs
- Missing dependencies
- Existing file conflicts
- Permission issues

## Current Test Coverage Status

### Well Tested Commands
- **addignore**: Comprehensive integration tests
- **adopt**: Extensive tests including rollback scenarios
- **deprovision**: Tests clearing of provisioning state
- **fill**: Tests template generation dynamically
- **genconfig**: Tests config generation and file writing
- **init**: Tests pack creation with templates
- **link**: Tests configuration deployment
- **list**: Tests pack discovery
- **down**: Tests combined deprovision + unlink
- **up**: Tests combined link + provision
- **provision**: Tests two-phase execution
- **status**: Tests state inspection
- **unlink**: Tests cleanup operations

### Testing Gaps Remaining
1. **End-to-End Workflows**: Need tests that run full sequences like:
   - init → fill → adopt → link → provision → status
   
2. **Real Filesystem Tests**: Most tests use memory FS, need some with real FS for:
   - Symlink behavior
   - Permission handling
   - Cross-platform issues

3. **Handler Integration**: Need tests that verify:
   - Shell profiles are actually sourceable
   - Homebrew files are valid syntax
   - Install scripts execute properly

## Lessons Learned

1. **Tests Must Verify Functionality**: A passing test that only checks file existence can hide broken features
2. **Integration Points Matter**: Commands that depend on each other need integration tests
3. **Use Proper Abstractions**: Filesystem injection makes tests reliable and fast
4. **Test the User Experience**: Tests should verify what users actually care about

## Next Steps

1. Add end-to-end test suite for complete workflows
2. Add selected real filesystem tests for critical operations
3. Monitor test coverage and maintain > 80% threshold
4. Review tests during code review to ensure they test actual functionality
