I'm looking for feedback on how far to push the "no-state" design principle.

First, my rationale: dotfiles managers fall largely into two camps: the complete
unified packages and the YOLO shell scripts.

the former provide this really integrated experience, but invariably they
overlap with source control and package managers. that is they embrace the
handling / listing of changes and they have various facilities for installing /
updating / partial executions of config packages.

the latter are some degrees of shell scripts that copy , link and run files
with little structure, control, safety or consistency.

dodot aims for a sweet spot that : 
- let's git handle the source control 
- forgo the packager manager aspect entirely by  a simple and safe model.
