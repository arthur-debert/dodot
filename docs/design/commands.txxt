                Commands in dodot

    dodot aims for simplicity, hence the only core command is deploy: 

      $ dodot deploy (deploys all packs in your DOTFILES_ROOT)
      $ dodot desploy <pack...> (deploy the selected packs only)

    There are a couple of auxiliary commands : 

      1. dodot fill <path>
