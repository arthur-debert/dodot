dodot Simple Configuration Design
=================================

Pack Configuration (.dodot.toml)
--------------------------------

Each pack can have a .dodot.toml file that tells dodot:
1. Whether to skip the entire pack
2. Which files to ignore
3. Which power-up should handle specific files

That's it.

Basic Structure
---------------

```toml
# Skip the entire pack (aliases: skip, disabled, ignore)
skip = true

# Simple file rules
[files]
"secrets.txt" = "ignore"           # Don't process this file at all
"my-aliases.sh" = "profile"        # Use profile power-up instead of default
"*.bak" = "ignore"                 # Ignore all backup files
"install-deps.sh" = "install"      # Use install power-up for this script
```

How It Works
------------

1. **No file rules**: dodot uses its default matchers (e.g., .vimrc â†’ symlink)
2. **"ignore"**: File is completely skipped, no power-up processes it
3. **"powerup-name"**: Override the default and use this specific power-up
4. **Patterns**: Support glob patterns for matching multiple files

Examples
--------

### Example 1: Simple vim pack

```toml
[files]
"*.swp" = "ignore"                 # Don't deploy swap files
"init.lua" = "symlink"             # Ensure this goes to home (if defaults change)
```

### Example 2: Mixed configs pack

```toml
[files]
# Ignore temporary and private files
"*.tmp" = "ignore"
"private-*" = "ignore"
"TODO.txt" = "ignore"

# Override defaults
"setup.sh" = "install"             # Run this as install script
"aliases-work.sh" = "profile"      # Add to shell profile
"Brewfile.lock.json" = "ignore"    # Don't deploy the lock file
```

### Example 3: Skip entire pack

```toml
skip = true  # or disabled = true, or ignore = true
```

Implementation Details
----------------------

The file rules are checked in this order:
1. If pack has skip=true, skip entire pack
2. Check [files] for exact match
3. Check [files] for glob pattern match
4. Use default matchers if no rule found

Simplifications from Current Implementation
-------------------------------------------

Remove these fields from PackConfig:
- description (not needed for functionality)
- priority (adds complexity, rarely needed)
- matchers array (replaced by simpler [files] section)
- powerup_options (can be added later if truly needed)

The only fields needed:
- skip/disabled/ignore (boolean)
- files (map[string]string)

Benefits
--------

1. **Dead Simple**: Users can understand it in 10 seconds
2. **Covers 99% of Use Cases**: Ignore files or override power-up choice
3. **No Learning Curve**: "ignore" and power-up names are self-explanatory
4. **Backwards Compatible**: Existing skip/disabled fields still work
5. **Predictable**: No priority battles, no complex merging

What This Doesn't Support
-------------------------

- Custom matcher patterns (use built-in ones)
- Power-up configuration (use defaults)
- Complex precedence rules (not needed)
- Per-file power-up options (too complex)

These limitations are features - they keep dodot simple and predictable.
