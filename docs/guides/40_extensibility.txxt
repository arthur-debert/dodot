                   Extensibility

This document explains how dodot's registry pattern enables extensibility
and how new triggers and power-ups can be conceptually added to the
system.

Registry Pattern
----------------

dodot uses a type-safe registry system that allows components to be
discovered and used dynamically:

Core Registries:
• TriggerRegistry - Available file matching strategies
• PowerUpRegistry - Available action generators
• MatcherRegistry - Available trigger-to-power-up bindings

This pattern enables:
• Plugin-like architecture without complex plugin systems
• Easy addition of new functionality
• Type-safe component discovery
• Clean separation between core and extensions

How Extension Works
-------------------

Adding New Triggers:

A trigger is a file matching strategy. To add a new trigger:

1. Implement the trigger interface
2. Register it in the TriggerRegistry
3. Create matchers that use the new trigger

Example use cases:
• ContentTrigger - Match files by content patterns
• SizeTrigger - Match files by size thresholds  
• TimeTrigger - Match files by modification time
• PermissionTrigger - Match files by permissions

Adding New Power-ups:

A power-up processes matched files and generates actions. To add a new
power-up:

1. Implement the power-up interface
2. Register it in the PowerUpRegistry
3. Define what actions it generates

Example use cases:
• EncryptionPowerUp - Encrypt/decrypt sensitive files
• TemplatePowerUp - Process template files with variables
• CompressionPowerUp - Compress large configuration files
• SyncPowerUp - Synchronize with cloud storage

Adding New Actions:

Actions describe high-level operations. New actions require:

1. Define the action type and data structure
2. Implement action-to-operation translation
3. Register the translation logic

Example use cases:
• EncryptAction - Encrypt file before deployment
• NetworkAction - Download remote configurations
• DatabaseAction - Store configuration in database
• NotificationAction - Send deployment notifications

Extension Points
----------------

Configuration Extension:
• .dodot.toml files can reference new triggers and power-ups
• Global configuration can define new matchers
• Command-line options can override registries

Matcher System Extension:
The matcher system is the primary extension point:

```toml
[[override]]
  path = "*.encrypted"
  powerup = "encryption"
  with = { 
    key_file = "~/.keys/dotfiles.key",
    cipher = "AES256" 
  }
```

This would use a hypothetical encryption power-up for encrypted files.

Registry Composition:
Registries can be composed and layered:
• Core registries provide built-in functionality
• User registries add custom components
• Pack-specific registries for special cases

Conceptual Extensions
---------------------

Template System:
A template power-up could process files with variable substitution:
• Match files with .template extension
• Replace variables with environment values
• Generate final configuration files

Example: database.conf.template → database.conf with actual passwords

Secret Management:
A secrets power-up could integrate with password managers:
• Match files containing secret references
• Replace references with actual secrets
• Support multiple secret backends (pass, 1Password, etc.)

Platform Adaptation:
A platform power-up could handle OS-specific configurations:
• Match files with platform suffixes (.macos, .linux)
• Deploy appropriate version based on current OS
• Handle platform-specific paths and conventions

Cloud Synchronization:
A sync power-up could manage cloud-stored configurations:
• Match configuration files that should be synchronized
• Upload/download from cloud storage
• Handle conflict resolution

Development Workflow:
A development power-up could integrate with development tools:
• Generate IDE configuration from templates
• Manage project-specific settings
• Handle development environment setup

Extension Guidelines
--------------------

Interface Compliance:
New components must implement the defined interfaces:
• Triggers return TriggerMatch objects
• Power-ups return Action slices
• Actions contain type, description, and data

Pure Functions:
Extensions should follow the pure function principle:
• Same inputs produce same outputs
• No side effects during processing
• Filesystem operations only through actions

Error Handling:
Extensions should use typed errors:
• Provide error codes for testing
• Include helpful error messages
• Support error context and details

Configuration Support:
Extensions should support configuration:
• Accept options through the "with" table
• Provide sensible defaults
• Validate configuration inputs

Registry Benefits
-----------------

Discoverability:
• Components can be listed and introspected
• Help systems can document available options
• Configuration can be validated against available components

Flexibility:
• Mix and match triggers with different power-ups
• Override defaults without modifying core code
• Create pack-specific behaviors

Testing:
• Components can be tested in isolation
• Mock registries enable unit testing
• Registry state doesn't affect test isolation

Maintenance:
• New functionality doesn't require core changes
• Extensions can be developed independently
• Backwards compatibility is easier to maintain

Future Directions
-----------------

Plugin System:
The registry pattern provides foundation for a future plugin system:
• Load external components from shared libraries
• Discover plugins in standard directories
• Manage plugin dependencies and versions

Configuration Schema:
Future versions could provide schema validation:
• Validate power-up options against schemas
• Provide better error messages for configuration
• Enable IDE support for configuration files

Performance Optimization:
Registry pattern enables performance improvements:
• Lazy loading of unused components
• Parallel execution of independent power-ups
• Caching of expensive operations

Integration APIs:
The extensibility model could support external integrations:
• REST APIs for remote power-ups
• Message queue integration for async operations
• Webhook support for deployment notifications

The registry pattern ensures dodot remains simple while providing
powerful extension capabilities for advanced users and integrations.
