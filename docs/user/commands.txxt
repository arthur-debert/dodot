                   dodot Commands

This document describes all available dodot commands and their usage.

Pack Commands
-------------

Pack commands operate on one or more packs using the format:
$ dodot <command> <pack1> ... <packN>

When no pack names are specified, the command operates on all packs in your dotfiles root.

1. install
----------

Install and deploy a pack. This is a superset of deploy that runs all
"run-once" power-ups (install scripts and Brewfiles) before deploying
configurations.

Usage:
$ dodot install              # Install all packs
$ dodot install <pack>       # Install specific pack
$ dodot install vim git ssh  # Install multiple packs

Options:
• --force - Force re-execution of run-once power-ups even if already executed

Behavior:
• Runs install.sh scripts (install_script power-up)
• Processes Brewfiles (homebrew power-up)  
• Creates symlinks (symlink power-up)
• Updates shell profiles (shell_profile power-up)
• Adds directories to PATH (shell_add_path power-up)

2. deploy
---------

Deploy pack configurations without running install scripts. Creates symlinks
and updates shell configurations but skips run-once power-ups.

Usage:
$ dodot deploy         # Deploy all packs
$ dodot deploy <pack>  # Deploy specific pack

Use this when you only want to update symlinks and shell configurations
without re-running expensive install operations.

3. status
---------

Show the deployment status for given pack(s). Displays information about
installed components, symlinks, and shell modifications.

Usage:
$ dodot status         # Show status for all packs
$ dodot status <pack>  # Show status for specific pack

Example output:
```
vim pack:
  install: ran install.sh on 2024-01-15 (has since changed)
  homebrew: installed on 2024-01-15 (no changes)
  symlink: vim/vimrc -> $HOME/.vimrc
  shell_profile: vim/aliases.sh sourced in shell profile
```

4. list
-------

Show all available packs in your dotfiles directory.

Usage:
$ dodot list

Example output:
```
Packs:
  neovim
  ssh
  git
  tmux
```

5. init
-------

Create a new pack with placeholder files and configuration.

Usage:
$ dodot init <packname>

Creates a pack at <dotfiles>/<packname> with:
• Placeholder files for each power-up (install.sh, Brewfile, alias.sh, etc.)
• A concise readme.txt explaining the pack structure
• A .dodot.toml configuration file with commented examples

6. fill
-------

Add placeholder files for each power-up to an existing pack. Useful for
adding missing power-up files to packs created manually.

Usage:
$ dodot fill <pack>

For example, if a pack doesn't have an alias.sh file, one will be added.
After deployment, symlinks to these files enable live editing.

Global Options
--------------

• -v, -vv, -vvv - Increase logging verbosity (INFO, DEBUG, TRACE)
• --version - Show version information
• --help - Show help information

Environment Variables
---------------------

• DOTFILES_ROOT - Override path to your dotfiles directory (optional)
  - If not set, dodot will use the git repository root
  - If not in a git repo, uses current directory with a warning
• DODOT_DATA_DIR - Path for dodot data files (optional, defaults to ~/.local/share/dodot)

Examples
--------

Set up a new vim configuration:
```bash
$ dodot init vim
$ # Edit vim/vimrc, vim/install.sh, etc.
$ dodot install vim
```

Deploy all configurations:
```bash
$ dodot deploy
```

Check status of specific pack:
```bash
$ dodot status git
```

Force reinstall with verbose output:
```bash
$ dodot install --force -vv neovim
```
