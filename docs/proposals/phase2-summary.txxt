# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

Phase 2 of the handler type refactoring has been successfully completed. This phase addressed the core issue where handler filtering needed to happen earlier in the pipeline.

### Key Changes

1. **Added Type() Method to Handlers**
   - All handlers now implement a `Type()` method returning `HandlerTypeConfiguration` or `HandlerTypeCodeExecution`
   - RunMode() method marked as deprecated but kept for backward compatibility
   - New base Handler interface created that all handlers embed

2. **Fixed Handler Filtering**
   - Created `FilterMatchesByHandlerCategory()` function to filter matches before action generation
   - Link command now properly filters out code execution handlers at the match level
   - This prevents install scripts from even being considered in link-only mode

3. **Updated Pipeline Processing**
   - Modified pipeline to filter matches based on RunMode before generating actions
   - Link mode: only allows configuration handlers
   - Provision mode: allows all handler types

### Test Results

All tests are passing:
- The `TestLinkPacks_SkipInstallScripts` test now passes, confirming install scripts don't run in link mode
- Fixed `TestProvisionPacks_OnlySymlinks` test to account for dual-phase execution
- All other tests continue to pass

### Next Steps

Phase 3 can now proceed to:
1. Remove deprecated RunMode methods entirely
2. Add support for transformation handlers (template processing, decryption)
3. Further simplify the handler interface hierarchy
