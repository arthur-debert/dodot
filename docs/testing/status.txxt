=== Testing Infrastructure & Migration Status ===

This document tracks the implementation status of the new testing infrastructure and the migration progress for each package.

All work is to be done on branch tests/revamp.

== Package Migration Status ==

Note: Current test files will be renamed to *_toremove_test.go before migration begins.

Total Coverage:
- Old Tests (main branch): 69.56% (1675/2408 statements)
- New Tests (tests/revamp): 57.52% (2169/3771 statements)
- Migration Progress: 47.3% of test files migrated (52 new / 58 old)

Coverage Comparison Notes:
- Several packages show improved coverage after migration (e.g., datastore: 53.93% → 82.72%)
- pkg/core shows significant improvement: 49.32% → 82.3% with orchestration-focused tests
- pkg/executor maintained strong coverage: 80.87% with new orchestration tests
- pkg/shell achieved excellent coverage: 88.46% with comprehensive integration tests
- Some packages show decreased coverage due to partial migration (e.g., types: 87.27% → 31.46%)
- New test approach shows good coverage despite focusing on orchestration over integration

== Migration Phases ==

=== Phase 1: Infrastructure (COMPLETED) ===
- [x] Implement TestEnvironment
- [x] Implement MemoryFS
- [x] Implement MockDataStore
- [x] Implement builders and helpers
- [x] Create example migrations

=== Phase 2: Unit Tests ===
- [ ] Migrate pure unit tests first
- [ ] pkg/handlers/* (logic only)
- [ ] pkg/types, pkg/errors, pkg/config
- [ ] Establish patterns

=== Phase 3: Business Logic ===
- [ ] Migrate pkg/commands/*
- [ ] Focus on command orchestration
- [ ] Remove FS dependencies

=== Phase 4: Integration Tests ===
- [x] Migrate pkg/core
- [x] Migrate pkg/executor (orchestration tests)
- [x] Migrate pkg/shell (integration tests)
- [ ] Complex pipeline tests

=== Phase 5: Special Cases ===
- [ ] pkg/datastore (real FS)
- [ ] pkg/handlers/symlink (symlink verification)
- [ ] End-to-end smoke tests

=== Phase 6: Cleanup ===
- [ ] Remove all *_toremove_test.go files
- [ ] Update CI configuration
- [ ] Performance validation (<2s target)

== Success Metrics ==

- **Performance**: <2s total test time (from 15s)
- **Isolation**: Zero flaky tests
- **Clarity**: Each test has single purpose
- **Coverage**: Maintain >80% coverage
- **Maintainability**: <5 test failures per feature change

== Example Migrations Created ==

1. **Unit Test**: pkg/errors/errors_test.go
   - Pure logic testing with no dependencies
   - Tests error creation, wrapping, and utilities
   - Clear test naming and structure

2. **Handler Test**: pkg/handlers/symlink/symlink_test.go  
   - Mix of unit and integration testing
   - Uses MockDataStore and MemoryFS
   - Tests action creation, status checking, and clearing

3. **Command Test**: pkg/commands/link/link_test.go
   - Business logic integration testing
   - Full command orchestration with mocks
   - Tests multiple scenarios including conflicts

4. **Output Test**: pkg/ui/output/renderer_test.go
   - Pure data transformation testing
   - No filesystem or external dependencies
   - Tests different rendering scenarios

5. **Shell Integration Test**: pkg/shell/shell_integration_test.go
   - Tests InstallShellIntegration orchestration logic
   - Uses EnvIsolated with real filesystem for PROJECT_ROOT setup
   - Tests directory creation, file copying, permission setting
   - Handles missing scripts, permission errors, directory creation failures

6. **Executor Orchestration Test**: pkg/executor/executor_orchestration_test.go
   - Tests New constructor with option validation and defaults
   - Tests Execute method with multiple actions, error handling, dry run
   - Tests handlePostExecution for LinkAction, RunScriptAction, BrewAction
   - Tests error propagation from action execution and post-execution
   - Uses real types.Action implementations for proper type assertions

== Notes ==

- Tests marked "REAL FS ALLOWED" can use actual filesystem
- All other tests must use memory/mocks
- Update status as components are implemented
- Track specific issues/blockers in Notes column
- Example migrations demonstrate all major test patterns
