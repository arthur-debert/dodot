# Dodot Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the major refactoring completed to improve the architecture and organization of the dodot codebase.

## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Type Extraction (Completed)
1. **Business Logic Extraction**
   - Moved business logic from data types to dedicated manager/aggregator classes
   - Created `pkg/execution/context/manager.go` for ExecutionContext operations
   - Created `pkg/execution/results/aggregator.go` for PackExecutionResult operations

2. **Rules Package Creation**
   - Created `pkg/rules/` to separate rule matching from handler execution
   - Moved scanner.go, config.go, and rule types from handlers/pipeline

3. **Dependency Resolution**
   - Moved HandlerCategory type from handlers to operations package
   - Resolved circular dependencies between handlers and operations

### Phase 2: Pack Reorganization (Completed)
1. **Pipeline → Execution Rename**
   - Renamed `pkg/packs/pipeline/` to `pkg/packs/execution/`
   - Updated all references and imports

2. **Command Consolidation**
   - Moved pipeline commands to main commands directory
   - Created `pkg/packs/operations/` for pack operation logic

3. **Core Package Elimination**
   - Moved pack discovery to `pkg/packs/discovery/`
   - Moved output generation to `pkg/ui/output/`
   - Moved initialization to `pkg/handlers/`
   - Successfully removed the core package

### Phase 3: Handler Reorganization (Completed)
1. **Handler Pipeline Movement**
   - Moved handler pipeline from `pkg/handlers/pipeline/` to `pkg/execution/pipeline/`
   - Updated all imports and references

## Current Structure

```
pkg/
├── dispatcher/          # Still in use (couldn't be moved due to import cycles)
├── execution/          
│   ├── context/        # Execution context management
│   ├── pipeline/       # Handler execution pipeline
│   ├── results/        # Result aggregation
│   └── status.go       # Execution status types
├── handlers/           
│   ├── lib/           # Individual handler implementations
│   ├── api.go         # Handler registry
│   └── init.go        # Handler initialization
├── operations/         # Operation definitions and execution
├── packs/             
│   ├── commands/      # Pack command implementations
│   ├── discovery/     # Pack discovery logic
│   ├── execution/     # Pack execution orchestration
│   └── operations/    # Pack-specific operations
├── rules/             # Rule matching system
└── ui/
    └── output/        # Output generation (config, snippets)
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clearer Separation of Concerns**
   - Data types are pure data structures
   - Business logic is in dedicated service classes
   - Rule matching is separate from execution

2. **Better Package Organization**
   - Related functionality is grouped together
   - Package names reflect their purpose
   - Reduced coupling between packages

3. **Improved Testability**
   - Business logic can be tested independently
   - Cleaner interfaces between components

## Known Issues

1. **Import Cycles**
   - The dispatcher couldn't be moved to execution package due to circular dependencies
   - This would require further architectural changes to resolve

2. **Incomplete Implementations**
   - Some stub implementations were added (e.g., in operations/status_impl.go)
   - These need to be properly implemented

## Next Steps

1. Complete the stub implementations in the operations package
2. Consider further refactoring to resolve the dispatcher import cycle
3. Update all documentation to reflect the new structure
4. Add architecture diagrams showing the new component relationships
