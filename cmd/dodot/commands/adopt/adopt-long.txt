The adopt command moves existing configuration files from your home directory
(or other locations) into a dodot pack, replacing them with symlinks.

This is useful when you want to start managing existing dotfiles with dodot.
The original files are moved into the pack directory and symlinks are created
in their original locations, pointing to the pack files.

By default, adopt will fail if the target file already exists in the pack.
Use --force to overwrite existing files in the pack.
