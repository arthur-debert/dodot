                   dodot Architecture
                   ==================

dodot is built around a simple, composable architecture that processes
dotfiles through a pipeline of triggers, matchers, and handlers.

Core Concepts
-------------

1. Packs
   Directory-based organization units for related configurations
   Example: vim/, zsh/, git/

2. Triggers
   Pattern-matching engines that identify files to process
   - FileNameTrigger: matches exact filenames
   - DirectoryTrigger: matches directory names
   - GlobTrigger: matches using glob patterns

3. Handlers
   Action generators that create operations from matched files
   - SymlinkHandler: creates symlinks
   - ShellProfileHandler: adds shell sourcing
   - InstallScriptHandler: runs install scripts
   - BrewfileHandler: processes Homebrew bundles

4. Actions
   High-level operations to be performed
   - CreateSymlink
   - UpdateShellProfile
   - RunInstallScript
   - ProcessBrewfile

Processing Pipeline
-------------------

1. GetPacks() - Discovers pack directories
2. GetFiringTriggers() - Finds files matching triggers
3. GetActions() - Handlers generate actions from matches
4. GetFsOps() - Actions produce filesystem operations
5. Execute - Operations are applied to the system

Key Design Principles
---------------------

• Stateless - no database, git handles versioning
• Composable - mix and match triggers/handlers
• Safe - preview with --dry-run, backup before overwrite
• Simple - directories and symlinks, no magic
