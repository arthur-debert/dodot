Add-ignore creates a .dodotignore file in the specified pack, which tells dodot
to skip that pack during all operations (deploy, install, status).

This is useful when you want to temporarily disable a pack without deleting it
or moving it out of your dotfiles repository. The pack remains in your dotfiles
directory but is completely ignored by dodot.

To re-enable a pack, simply delete the .dodotignore file from the pack directory.
