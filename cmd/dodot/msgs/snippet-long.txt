The snippet command outputs the shell integration code that you need to add to your shell configuration file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc, .config/fish/config.fish).

By default, it outputs the snippet for bash/zsh. Use the --shell flag to specify fish or other shells.

Use the --install flag to install the shell integration scripts to your data directory. This is typically needed on first setup:

    # First time setup - install scripts then add snippet
    dodot snippet --install >> ~/.zshrc

    # Just output the snippet (after scripts are installed)
    dodot snippet >> ~/.zshrc

After adding the snippet to your shell config, restart your shell or source the config file to enable dodot's shell integration.
