Adopt existing configuration files into a pack by moving them to your dotfiles
repository and immediately creating symlinks back to their original locations.

This command streamlines the process of bringing files under dodot's management:
1. Moves the source file/directory to the specified pack
2. Creates a symlink from the original location to the new location

The adoption is atomic - the file is moved and symlinked in one operation,
ensuring your configuration continues to work without interruption.

Smart path handling:
- Files from $HOME go to the pack root (e.g., ~/.gitconfig -> pack/gitconfig)
- Files from XDG paths preserve their structure (e.g., ~/.config/app/config.toml -> pack/app/config.toml)

Safety features:
- Won't overwrite existing files in the pack (use --force to override)
- Detects if a file is already managed by dodot and exits gracefully
- Shows clear output for each operation performed
