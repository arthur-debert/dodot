Provision runs both provisioning actions (install scripts, Homebrew packages)
and linking actions (symlinks, shell profiles, PATH entries) for your dotfiles.

This is a complete setup command that:
1. First runs all provisioning handlers (install scripts, brewfiles)
2. Then runs all linking handlers (symlinks, profiles, paths)

Use --force to re-run provisioning handlers that have already been executed.
