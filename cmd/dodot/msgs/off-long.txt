The off command removes all deployments for specified packs, effectively "turning off"
those configurations without removing the source files from your dotfiles repository.

This is useful when you want to:
- Temporarily disable a pack's configurations
- Clean up deployments before removing a pack from your dotfiles
- Reset a pack's deployment state

The command will:
- Remove all symlinks created by the pack
- Remove PATH additions and shell profile sources
- Clean up intermediate state files
- Leave source files in your dotfiles repository untouched

Use --dry-run to preview what would be removed without making changes.
