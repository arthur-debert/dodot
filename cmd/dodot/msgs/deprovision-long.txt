The deprovision command removes provisioning state for specified packs,
effectively uninstalling or clearing resources that were deployed by
provisioning handlers.

This command only affects provisioning handlers (homebrew, provision)
and preserves all linking handler state (symlinks, path, shell).

When run without any pack names, it will deprovision all packs.
Use the --dry-run flag to preview what would be removed without
making any changes.

Note: This command removes dodot's state tracking for provisioning
operations. The actual uninstallation of packages or resources depends
on the specific handler implementation.
