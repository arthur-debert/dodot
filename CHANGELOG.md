## [0.17.0] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Symlink handler now deploys every pack-root entry — file or directory — to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/<pack>/<name>` by default (#48). Previously, top-level files defaulted to `$HOME/.<name>` and top-level directories to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/<name>` (no pack namespace). The new rule is consistent across files and dirs and matches modern tool conventions (nvim, helix, ghostty, kitty, alacritty, lazygit, starship, …) without forcing users to write `pack/program/` doubled paths.
- **BREAKING:** Per-file `$HOME` opt-in convention renamed: `dot.X` → `home.X`. The semantic is unchanged (`<pack>/home.bashrc` → `~/.bashrc`); the new name reads as "deploy to home as .X" instead of "this filename has a literal dot." All `[symlink.targets]`, `_home/`, `_xdg/`, `force_home`, and `protected_paths` overrides keep their existing semantics.
- The `_home/` and `_xdg/` directory prefixes are now always per-file (never wholesale-linked at the top level) — wholesale-linking the prefix dir itself would have baked the literal `_home`/`_xdg` segment into the deploy path, which is never what users meant.

### Migration notes (#48)

- A pack with `git/gitconfig` previously deployed to `~/.gitconfig`. It now deploys to `~/.config/git/gitconfig` (which git itself reads via XDG since 2.20). To keep the legacy `$HOME` path, rename the file to `git/home.gitconfig` (per-file home opt-in) or add a `[symlink.targets]` override.
- A pack with `warp/themes/` previously deployed to `~/.config/themes`. It now deploys to `~/.config/warp/themes`. Pin consumers to the new path or use `_xdg/themes/` inside the pack to skip the namespace.
- A pack with `git/dot.gitconfig` (old per-file convention) needs to be renamed to `git/home.gitconfig` — `dot.X` is no longer recognized.
- A pack containing literal `config/` or `.config/` subdirectory paths (e.g. `app/config/main.toml`) used to have that prefix silently stripped during resolution to avoid the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.config/...` double-prefix. Under #48 the strip is gone; the file deploys to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/<pack>/config/main.toml` literally. If you relied on the old strip to land at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/main.toml`, move the file to the pack root (`app/main.toml` → `~/.config/app/main.toml`) or use `_xdg/main.toml` to skip the pack namespace entirely.
- No change for files matching `force_home` (ssh, gpg, bashrc, zshrc, profile, inputrc, etc.) — those still deploy to `$HOME/.<name>`.
- No change for files routed via `[symlink.targets]`, `_home/`, or `_xdg/` directory prefixes — those keep their existing behavior.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Provisioning script execution now prints `==== <pack> → <handler> → <script>  running…` before the spawn and `OK` (green) or `FAILED` (red) after, on stderr. Sentinel-skipped runs stay silent. Long-running scripts (e.g. brew installs) are no longer opaque from the user's side.

### Changed
- **`up` and `down` now render through `status::status()`** instead of using their own per-operation vocabulary. `dodot up video` and `dodot status video` produce identical right-column labels (`in PATH`, `sourced`, `deployed`) for the same observed state — previously `up` reported `staged bin` while `status` reported `in PATH`, which was confusing. Operation failures from `up` are overlaid as additional error rows on top of the status view. Dry-run output is unchanged (still shows planned operations). (#42)
- **`status` distinguishes "pending — clear to deploy" from "pending — would conflict on deploy"** (#43). When a non-symlink file or directory already occupies a symlink-handler target path, status renders the row with the `warning` style (label remains `pending` so the right column stays compact) and adds a per-pack footnote `(N) <path> (existing file/directory) — \`dodot up\` will refuse without --force`. Pre-existing symlinks (correct, dangling, or pointing elsewhere) are *not* flagged as conflicts because the executor's `create_user_link` gracefully replaces them on the next `up`.
- **`dodot up` auto-replaces content-equivalent pre-existing files** (#44). When `up` would deploy a symlink to a path where a regular file already exists, it now checks whether the file's content is byte-identical to the source. If so, it silently swaps the file for the dodot symlink chain — no `--force` required, no conflict reported. Direct (single-hop) symlinks pointing at the source — including relative-path symlinks — were already handled gracefully by `create_user_link`; this completes the picture for the file case. Multi-hop symlink chains are still replaced automatically (unchanged behavior). Only content-different non-symlink files still require `--force` — mismatched content is a real conflict.
- **`status` no longer flags content-equivalent files as conflicts** (#44). A pre-existing file at the user-target path whose bytes match the source is rendered as plain `pending` with no footnote, since `up` will handle it without `--force`.
- **`dodot adopt` distinguishes "fully managed" from "direct symlink to pack source"** (#44). When the user's existing symlink points directly into the dotfiles root (skipping dodot's data-link layer), adopt now skips with a clearer message that points at `dodot up <pack>` to upgrade to the full chain — instead of the previous opaque `already managed by dodot`. Sources whose symlinks already go through dodot's data dir keep the original wording.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Cross-pack conflict detection** (#29): `dodot up` now collects intents from all packs before executing any, detects when multiple packs produce symlinks targeting the same resolved path, and halts with a clear error listing conflicting packs, handlers, and source files — no partial deployment occurs
- `dodot status` surfaces potential cross-pack conflicts as warnings, even for packs that aren't deployed yet
- Symlink target collisions detected across all resolution layers: `[symlink.targets]`, `_home/` prefix, `dot.` convention, `force_home`, XDG defaults
- PATH executable shadowing detected: two packs with `bin/` directories containing same-named files are flagged (one would shadow the other in `$PATH`)
- **Auto-executable permissions**: `dodot up` now automatically adds `+x` to files in path-handler directories (`bin/`), matching user intent that these files should be runnable. Controlled by `[path] auto_chmod_exec` (default: `true`). Already-executable files are left untouched; permission failures are reported as warnings, not hard errors.
- New `CrossPackConflict` error variant with structured conflict data
- `dodot status` now lists directories skipped via `.dodotignore` under an "Ignored Packs" heading, so users aren't baffled when a pack-shaped directory doesn't appear in the main listing

### Changed
- **`mappings.shell` default now includes `env.sh`** alongside `aliases.sh`, `profile.sh`, `login.sh`. Files named `env.sh` in any pack are now claimed by the shell handler (sourced at shell init) instead of falling through to the symlink handler (which previously dropped them at `~/.env.sh` and collided across packs)
- `dodot up` now uses a two-phase execution model: collect all intents first, then execute — replacing the previous sequential per-pack execution
- `--force` does not override cross-pack conflicts (it only applies to pre-existing non-dodot files); cross-pack conflicts require a configuration fix
- Orchestration pipeline split into `collect_pack_intents()` and `execute_intents()` for composability
- **Scanner is top-level only** (#37): rules match pack depth-1 entries only; nested files are the responsibility of the handler that owns the containing top-level entry. Fixes two long-standing issues:
  - A pack's `bin/tool` was being **both** staged via the path handler *and* symlinked individually via the catchall — now only the `bin/` directory is claimed (by path). One shell command, one status line.
  - A nested `foo/install.sh` used to trigger the install handler because matching was on basename-only; now only a top-level `install.sh` does.
- **Symlink handler links top-level directories wholesale**: `warp/themes/` now becomes a single symlink `~/.config/themes → <pack>/warp/themes`, not a per-file listing. Falls back to per-file mode (current behavior) when `[symlink] protected_paths` or `[symlink.targets]` reach inside the directory, preserving every existing security guarantee.
- **Top-level dirs default to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/<name>`** (aligning code with the longstanding docs). Top-level *files* still default to `$HOME/.<name>`. `force_home`, `_home/`, `_xdg/`, `dot.`, and `targets` overrides all still apply.
- Handler trait gains `match_mode()` (`Precise` / `Catchall`) and `scope()` (`Exclusive` / `Shared`), with a registry invariant that at most one handler may be simultaneously `Catchall` + `Exclusive`. No behavior change for existing handlers; the formalization future-proofs adding non-claiming observers.
- `Handler::to_intents` now receives an `&dyn Fs` so handlers can inspect directory contents when deciding wholesale-vs-per-file treatment.

### Migration notes
- If you previously relied on nested files being individually symlinked (e.g. `warp/themes/nord.yaml → ~/.config/themes/nord.yaml`), the whole `themes/` directory is now one symlink. The observed path `~/.config/themes/nord.yaml` still resolves identically via the directory link.
- If you need nested per-file behavior (different targets per file, or selective inclusion), add `[symlink.targets]` entries or list individual files in `[symlink] protected_paths` — either triggers per-file mode for the containing directory.
- If you had nested `install.sh` / `aliases.sh` / `Brewfile` that were (perhaps unintentionally) being picked up by their handlers, move them to the pack's top level or use `[mappings]` overrides.

- Automatic cleanup of log files older than 7 days

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- CI: force Node.js 24 for all GitHub Actions (future-proofing for June 2026 deprecation)
- CI: replace manual `actions/cache` with `Swatinem/rust-cache` for smarter Rust caching

### Fixed
- Release workflow: add MIT license and crate metadata required by crates.io
- Release workflow: macOS signing failures no longer block binary packaging/upload
- Release workflow: fix cross-compilation install on runners with pre-existing `cross` binary

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- `[pack] ignore` now ships with sensible compiled defaults (`.git`, `.svn`, `.DS_Store`, `*.swp`, etc.) — previously the default was an empty list
- Exhaustive unit test verifying all compiled default values for `pack.ignore`, `symlink.force_home`, `symlink.protected_paths`, and all `mappings` fields

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** `[mappings] ignore` renamed to `[mappings] skip` to disambiguate from `[pack] ignore`
- Removed `genconfig` command — use `dodot config gen` (via clapfig) instead, which auto-generates a commented TOML template from struct definitions

### Fixed
- Config docs: removed phantom "App Defaults" and "App Config" layers that never existed in code; documented the actual 3-layer hierarchy (compiled defaults → root `.dodot.toml` → pack `.dodot.toml`)
- Config docs: corrected merge semantics from "arrays append" to "arrays override (last value wins)" matching actual clapfig behavior
- Config docs: fixed `[symlink]` targets syntax from incorrect bare keys to correct `[symlink.targets]` table form
- Synced `force_home` defaults in docs (was 6 entries, now all 10 matching code)
- Synced `protected_paths` defaults across both doc files and code (was inconsistent between `config-system.lex` and `symlink-paths.lex`)
