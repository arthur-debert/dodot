# Suite 4: Single Power-up Edge Cases
# This suite tests edge cases for each power-up in isolation, focusing on
# error handling, boundary conditions, and unexpected inputs that might
# occur when power-ups are used individually.

# Load common test setup with debug support

# Setup before all tests
setup() {
    setup_with_debug
}

# Cleanup after each test
teardown() {
    teardown_with_debug
