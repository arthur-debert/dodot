Test Framework Self-Tests
========================

This scenario tests the test framework itself, specifically the setup_test_env
and clean_test_env functions that are used by all other tests.

Test Structure:
- dotfiles/test-pack/testfile.txt - Simple test file in a pack
- home/.test-home-file - Test file in home directory
- tests/setup_teardown.bats - Comprehensive tests for the framework

The tests verify:
1. Temporary directory creation with proper naming
2. Correct copying of dotfiles preserving structure
3. Correct copying of home directory files
4. Environment variable setting and restoration
5. Safe cleanup that only removes test directories
6. Handling of edge cases and error conditions
