# Suite 3: Tests multiple power-ups across multiple packs
# This suite validates that dodot correctly handles scenarios where:
# - Multiple packs are present in the dotfiles directory
# - Different packs use different power-ups (symlink, path, install_script, etc.)
# - Power-ups from different packs interact correctly (e.g., multiple PATH entries)
# - Operations are performed in the correct order across packs
