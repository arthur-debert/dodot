TEST SUITE STRUCTURE
====================

The test suite is organized into 5 progressive suites:

SUITE 1: SINGLE POWER-UPS (Foundation)
--------------------------------------
Location: suite-1-single-powerups/<power-up>/
Purpose: Test each power-up in isolation with YES/NO assertions
Status: Partially implemented

Implemented:
- symlink: YES test works, NO test stubbed
- shell-profile: YES test works, NO test stubbed  
- path: YES test works, NO test stubbed
- install-script: YES test skipped (known issue), NO test stubbed
- homebrew: YES test works, NO test stubbed
- template: Both YES and NO tests stubbed

SUITE 2: MULTIPLE POWER-UPS, SINGLE PACK
-----------------------------------------
Location: suite-2-multi-powerups-single-pack/
Purpose: Test power-up interactions within single packs
Status: All tests stubbed and marked as skip

Planned tests:
- Deploy-type power-ups combined
- Install-type power-ups combined
- Mixed deploy/install power-ups
- All power-ups in one pack

SUITE 3: MULTIPLE POWER-UPS, MULTIPLE PACKS
--------------------------------------------
Location: suite-3-multi-powerups-multi-packs/
Purpose: Test cross-pack interactions
Status: All tests stubbed and marked as skip

Planned tests:
- Simple multi-pack deploy
- Mixed multi-pack deploy/install
- Overlapping shell profiles
- Multiple path deployments

SUITE 4: SINGLE POWER-UP EDGE CASES
------------------------------------
Location: suite-4-single-powerup-edge-cases/
Purpose: Test edge cases for each power-up in isolation
Status: All tests stubbed and marked as skip

Planned tests:
- Symlink edge cases (missing source, existing target, etc.)
- Shell profile edge cases (empty files, syntax errors, etc.)
- Path edge cases (empty directories, non-executables, etc.)
- Install script edge cases (failures, long runtime, etc.)
- Homebrew edge cases (empty/invalid Brewfiles)
- Template edge cases (missing variables, invalid syntax)

SUITE 5: COMPLEX EDGE CASES
----------------------------
Location: suite-5-complex-edge-cases/
Purpose: Test complex multi-pack/power-up interactions
Status: All tests stubbed and marked as skip

Planned tests:
- File conflicts
- Dependency order
- State corruption
- Permission issues
- Large scale scenarios

DEPRECATED
----------
- basic: Mixed scenario with failing tests, scheduled for removal
- isolated-*: Migrated to suite-1-single-powerups
