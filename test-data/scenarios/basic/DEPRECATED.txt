DEPRECATED SCENARIO
===================

This scenario is deprecated and scheduled for removal.

Tests from this scenario have been reorganized into the new test suite structure:
- Suite 1: Single power-ups (basic YES/NO tests)  
- Suite 2: Multiple power-ups in single packs
- Suite 3: Multiple power-ups across multiple packs
- Suite 4: Single power-up edge cases
- Suite 5: Complex multi-pack/power-up edge cases

Many tests in this scenario are failing due to:
- Incorrect assertion expectations (path power-up)
- Known bugs (shell_profile duplicates, install_script artifacts)
- Template expansion issues

DO NOT ADD NEW TESTS HERE. Use the appropriate suite instead.

Migration status:
- Most single power-up tests → Suite 1 (completed)
- Multi-power-up tests → Suite 2-3 (placeholders created)
- Edge case tests → Suite 4-5 (placeholders created)
