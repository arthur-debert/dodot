# Suite 5: Complex Multi-Pack/Power-Up Edge Cases
# 
# This suite tests complex edge cases that involve interactions between multiple
# packs and power-ups, including conflict resolution, dependency ordering,
# state recovery, and large-scale deployments.

# Load common test setup with debug support
source /workspace/test-data/lib/common.sh

# Setup before all tests
setup() {
    setup_with_debug
}

# Cleanup after each test
teardown() {

@test "dependency order: pack A depends on pack B" {

    skip "Not implemented"
    # Test case with many packs using different combinations of power-ups
    # Should handle complex deployments efficiently
