Docker Integration Test Results
===============================

Date: 2025-07-31
Tester: Claude

Test Environment
----------------

- Docker Image: Ubuntu 22.04 with zsh
- Homebrew: Successfully installed (v4.5.13)
- dodot Binary: Linux build (compiled with GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64)
- Test User: testuser with sudo privileges

Test Results Summary
--------------------

OVERALL STATUS: PARTIAL SUCCESS - Critical bug identified

✅ PASSED:
- Docker environment builds successfully
- Homebrew installation works
- dodot binary runs without errors
- Command parsing and pack discovery work correctly
- Logging system functions properly
- Dry-run mode works as expected
- Manual symlink creation in container works

❌ FAILED:
- Symlink operations are not executed despite being reported as successful
- No actual filesystem changes occur during deployment
- Status command cannot verify deployments

Detailed Findings
-----------------

1. CRITICAL BUG: Operations Not Executed
........................................

dodot reports operations as performed but does not actually execute them:
- Operations are generated correctly (visible in debug logs)
- Success messages are displayed
- But no filesystem changes occur
- This affects all powerups that create files/symlinks

Evidence:
- Deploy reports "✓ Symlink .vimrc -> /home/testuser/.vimrc"
- But ls shows no symlink created
- Manual symlink creation works, confirming filesystem is writable

2. Logging and Debugging
........................

The verbose logging (-vvv) shows:
- Operations are generated twice (duplicate log entries)
- No "executing operation" messages appear
- Dry-run flag is correctly set to false
- All components up to operation generation work correctly

3. Test Infrastructure
......................

The Docker test environment is fully functional:
- All test scripts are accessible and executable
- Sample dotfiles are properly structured
- Environment variables are correctly set
- Container filesystem supports all operations

Recommendations
---------------

1. URGENT: Fix the operation execution bug in dodot core
   - Check if operations are actually being executed
   - Verify synthfs integration is working
   - Add logging for operation execution

2. Add integration tests to CI pipeline using this Docker setup
   - Can catch deployment issues before release
   - Provides safe testing environment

3. Enhance status command to actually verify symlinks exist

4. Consider adding a --verify flag to check operations succeeded

Test Scripts Available
----------------------

The following test scripts are ready for use once the bug is fixed:
- run-basic-tests.sh: 10 core functionality tests
- run-edge-case-tests.sh: 10 edge case scenarios  
- run-all-tests.sh: Complete test suite
- test-deploy.sh: Manual deployment verification
- test-debug.sh: Detailed debugging helper

How to Reproduce
----------------

1. Build Linux binary:
   $ cd .. && GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bin/dodot-linux ./cmd/dodot/main

2. Run container:
   $ cd test-environment
   $ ./docker-run.sh bash

3. Inside container:
   $ dodot deploy vim
   $ ls -la ~/.vimrc  # File will not exist despite success message

Next Steps
----------

1. File bug report for operation execution issue
2. Once fixed, re-run full test suite
3. Add Docker tests to CI pipeline
4. Consider adding operation verification to dodot itself
