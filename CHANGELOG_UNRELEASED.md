### Fixed

- Symlink deploys now refuse when an ancestor of the target path is a symlink resolving into `dotfiles_root` or `data_dir`. Writing through such an ancestor landed back inside the pack store — silently clobbering pack source files (top-level files built a pack↔data-dir cycle) or surfacing as a misleading `non-symlink file at target path` (pack directories). The check runs in both real and dry-run modes; `--force` does not bypass it. Relative ancestor targets like `~/.config/warp -> ../dotfiles/warp` are lexically normalized before the prefix comparison so they get caught too.
