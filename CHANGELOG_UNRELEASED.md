# Unreleased Changes

Add entries here as changes are made. On release, copy this content into
CHANGELOG.md under a new version heading and clear this file.

Use sections: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security.

### Added
- **Cross-pack conflict detection** (#29): `dodot up` now collects intents from all packs before executing any, detects when multiple packs produce symlinks targeting the same resolved path, and halts with a clear error listing conflicting packs, handlers, and source files — no partial deployment occurs
- `dodot status` surfaces potential cross-pack conflicts as warnings, even for packs that aren't deployed yet
- Symlink target collisions detected across all resolution layers: `[symlink.targets]`, `_home/` prefix, `dot.` convention, `force_home`, XDG defaults
- New `CrossPackConflict` error variant with structured conflict data

### Changed
- `dodot up` now uses a two-phase execution model: collect all intents first, then execute — replacing the previous sequential per-pack execution
- `--force` does not override cross-pack conflicts (it only applies to pre-existing non-dodot files); cross-pack conflicts require a configuration fix
- Orchestration pipeline split into `collect_pack_intents()` and `execute_intents()` for composability
