POWERUP TEST PATTERN ANALYSIS
=============================

1. SYMLINK_SPEC.SH (282 lines total)
   - Uses verify_symlink_deployed: 5 times
   - Uses verify_idempotent_deploy: 1 time  
   - Uses verify_pack_deployed: 1 time
   - Manual assertions: ~45 (test -d, test -L, cat checks, etc.)
   - Pattern: Heavy use of manual assertions alongside verification functions
   - Many tests use manual "cat" to verify content through symlinks
   - Manual directory existence checks with "test -d"
   - Manual symlink checks with "test -L"

2. SHELL_PROFILE_SPEC.SH (219 lines total)
   - Uses verify_shell_profile_deployed: 3 times
   - Uses verify_idempotent_deploy: 1 time
   - Manual assertions: ~30 (grep, test -d, test -f, bash -c, zsh -c, etc.)
   - Pattern: Similar to symlink - many manual assertions
   - Manual grep for content verification
   - Manual source tests with bash -c and zsh -c
   - Manual readlink comparisons for idempotency

3. INSTALL_SCRIPT_SPEC.SH (281 lines total)
   - Uses verify_install_script_deployed: 2 times
   - Manual assertions: ~50 (file existence, includes checks, executable checks)
   - Pattern: Mostly manual assertions
   - Has custom verify_sentinel helper function
   - Many "The file should exist/include" assertions
   - Manual directory checks with "The path should be directory"

4. BREWFILE_SPEC.SH (225 lines total)
   - Uses verify_brewfile_deployed: 7 times
   - Manual assertions: ~15 (file should not exist, output should include)
   - Pattern: DIFFERENT - relies more on verification functions
   - Less manual testing overall
   - Simpler test structure

5. MULTI_POWERUP_SPEC.SH (from partial read)
   - Uses verify_pack_deployed: Frequently for combined verification
   - Pattern: Uses composite verification for multiple powerups

KEY OBSERVATIONS:
=================

1. Manual Assertion Types:
   - File content checks: cat, grep
   - File existence: test -f, "The file should exist"
   - Directory checks: test -d, "The path should be directory"
   - Symlink verification: test -L, readlink
   - Permission checks: test -w, "should be executable"
   - Output content: "The output should include/equal"

2. Verification Function Usage:
   - Symlink tests: Mix of both (5 functions, ~45 manual)
   - Shell profile: Mix of both (4 functions, ~30 manual)
   - Install script: Mostly manual (2 functions, ~50 manual)
   - Brewfile: Mostly functions (7 functions, ~15 manual)

3. Patterns:
   - Brewfile is an OUTLIER - it relies heavily on verification functions
   - Other tests keep manual assertions even when functions exist
   - Manual assertions often test specific implementation details
   - Verification functions test higher-level success

4. Why Manual Assertions Remain:
   - Testing specific error messages
   - Verifying intermediate states
   - Checking exact file permissions
   - Testing shell compatibility (bash vs zsh)
   - Verifying exact output format
   - Testing error conditions that functions don't cover

CONCLUSION:
===========
The brewfile test is indeed different from the others. While most tests maintain
30-50 manual assertions alongside verification functions, brewfile has only ~15
manual assertions and relies heavily on its verification function (7 calls).

The other tests appear to intentionally keep manual assertions to:
1. Test implementation details the verification functions don't check
2. Provide more granular error messages when tests fail
3. Verify exact behavior rather than just "success"
4. Test error paths and edge cases

The brewfile test might be:
- Newer and following a different pattern
- Simpler in nature (just needs to verify brew was called)
- Missing some detailed checks the other tests have
